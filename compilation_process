Steps in compilation:
1. Preprocessing (-E, .i)
2. Compilation (-S, .s)
3. Assembler (-c, .o)
4. Linker (, .out)

Preprocessing:
In this step all the macros, include files, conditional compilation are expanded.
Output of this stage is file with extension .i
g++ -E sample.cpp 

Compilation:
In this satge preprocessed file is converted into assembly language corresponding to 
hardware or system on which it will run
Output of this stage is file with extension .s
g++ -S sample.i

Assembler:
In this stage assembly level code is converted into machine language. 
The code is converted into 1's and 0's
Output of this stage is object files with extension .o
g++ -c sample.s

Linker:
At this stage mutiple .o files can be linked together, all external functions or 
library function symbols are resolved and then executable is produced.
g++ sample.s -o sample.out
