Stages of compilation

Memory structure

new vs malloc

endl vs "\n"

push_back vs emplace

FizzBuzz - %3 Fizz %5 Buzz %15 FizzBuzz

[1, 3, 4, 5, 6] => [360, 120, 90, 72, 60] Do it with/without division

Implement final class

PIMPL

Polymorphic classes need not have virtual destructors when used in shared_ptr

cat file | grep text

cat file | sort -> implement similar 

[dog, cat, god, fired, fired, diref] => [{cat}, {dog, god}, {fired, fried, diref}]
